		<h2>To Prospective Students and Parents of IIIT-H</h2>
		<br/>
		<p>Congratulations on your academic achievements and thank you for choosing International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad for the next leg of your life’s journey. IIIT-H is a different institution; I want to briefly explain our core philosophy as you prepare to join it as a student.</p>

		<p>The primary objective of education at IIIT-H is to impart a <i style="font-style: italic">mature world-view</i> and a <i style="font-style: italic">long term vision</i> to the students. We do not want to just transmit technical skills or scientific knowledge. Providing skills for a high-profile first job is definitely not institute's primary objective; equipping the student to be ready for her last job excite us more.</p>

		<p>Let’s consider the skill of driving a car. Efficient driving (spending less fuel, reducing wear-and-tear) needs a deep understanding of the scientific and engineering principles that govern automobiles. While the skill and the knowledge are important, neither will help you choose the right destination for your journey. We want you as a student of IIIT-H to acquire a world-view that helps you choose the destination that is most fulfilling <b style="font-weight: bold;">to you</b>, with the science and the skills helping in that journey.</p>

		<p>IIIT-H, Hyderabad is a research university. It has been rated among top technology schools of the country by different sources, notably as the #3 technology school in India by Dataquest recently. However, we measure our success in terms of the research done at the institute and take pride in the impact we have on the society. Faculty and students at the institute work on several innovative technologies with large potential. These include Artificial Intelligence, language translation, speech recognition and synthesis, robotics, data mining, computer vision, VLSI, communications, information security, structural safety, energy-efficient building, computer-aided drug-design, etc.</p>

		<p>IIIT-H provides a research option to the BTech students from the very beginning. Those opting for research get a B.Tech (Honours) degree in 4 years, and can opt for an MS by Research degrees in 5 years. UG research is an integral element of our design. Our bachelors students leave with a deeper understanding of the area as a result. About two dozen top-class publications emerge from IIIT-H with undergraduate co-authors every year. The ability to solve unstructured and unseen problems is essential to do well in a fast-changing world of tomorrow, preparing the student for that last job!</p>

		<p>We have an atmosphere at the Institute that promotes extra-curricular activities and deep introspection. We have a highly acclaimed course on Human Values to tempt students to contemplate on their roles in life broadly. Our true goal is often to impact the society deeply; the immediate concerns about comforts are very minor in comparison. Each of you will have your own ideas about what your own impact should be. We want you to find your own way, without any pressure from outside.</p>

		<p>Financial Assistance is given to those in need at IIIT-H. Bank loans are available easily to those enrolled at IIIT-H. In addition, IIIT-H Special Financial Scheme (ISFAS) is available to needy students, facilitated by donations from our alumni.</p>

		<p>If you long for a significant impact on the world through technology, then IIIT-H is the right institute for you. While studying at IIIT-H you’ll be expected to work hard, have a true aptitude in the subject area, and possess the right attitude. Walk in boldly and confidently  through the portals of IIIT-H for an exciting and fruitful journey.</p>
